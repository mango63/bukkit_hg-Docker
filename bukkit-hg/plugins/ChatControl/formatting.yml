#                  Welcome to ChatControl's Chat Formatting Configuration
#
#   In this configuration you can setup how the message in the chat should look like.
# 
#   Since we support different message formats per different permissions,
#   per channels, or many other places in the plugin, you can create a so-called
#   formats that can be reused multiple times.
#
#   For configuration, see:
#   - https://github.com/kangarko/ChatControl-Pro/wiki/Formats
#
#   For variables, see:
#   - https://github.com/kangarko/ChatControl-Pro/wiki/Variables
#
#   Remember, you can remove or edit all formats below, and create your own ones!

# Here are the actual formats. A format represents how a message should look like.
# Each format consists of Parts (each part is configured individually).
#
# You can re-use them in different parts of the plugin, for example in chat channels.
#
# For tutorial, see https://github.com/kangarko/ChatControl-Pro/wiki/Formats
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Formats:  
  #
  # This is a very basic format named "Chat" used by default to format your main chat.
  #
  # You can name this whatever you want, however you will use
  # the name in other places of the plugin if you call 'Chat'.
  #
  Chat:
    # The first part (you can name all parts whatever you want)
    # that simply renders players prefix, and also contains
    # some fancy hover and click elements.
    First_Part: 
      # The message that is shown in the chat.
      # In this case the variable ends with +, meaning we insert a
      # space " " automatically if prefix is not empty. Note only few variables
      # have this special feature, see our GitHub.
      Message: "&7{pl_prefix+}"
      # This part contains hover event which display an optional
      # message when you move your mouse over that chat part.
      #
      # Unlike the part name, you must name this "Hover_Event"
      Hover_Event: 
        # What action should happen when you put your mouse on this part?
        Action: SHOW_TEXT
        # The messages that are shown to you in game.

          - "&7Prefix&8: &7{pl_prefix}"
          - "&7Group&8: &b{pl_group}"

    # The second part simply displays the player's name.
    Second_Part:
      # The message that is shown in the chat.
      # If you want to show player's nick instead, use {nick}
      Message: "{player}&7: &f"
      # And show some fancy hover text, see above.

        Action: SHOW_TEXT
        Values:
        - "&7Message issued: &b{timestamp}"

      # This part also contains click event feature that will 
      # write /msg <playername> into your chat when clicked.
      #
      # Unlike the part name, you must name this "Click_Event"
      Click_Event:
        # What action should happen when you click on this part?
        Action: SUGGEST_COMMAND
        # The message or value when action is fired.
        Value: '/msg {player} '
